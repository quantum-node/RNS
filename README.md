Relational (or Relative) Name Service Model

If I know Julie, Mike and Bob, and Mike knows Fred Fredericksen and the other two know Fred Logan, and all 3 have related anecdotes to me about Fred without including his surname - or if I forget whose surname is whose - I understand Fred Fredericksen as "the Fred whom Mike knows" and Fred Logan as "the Fred whom Julie and Bob know" (assuming I know that Julie and Bob were talking about the same Fred). This is the basis for my relational name service model.
